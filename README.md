# Bash Scripting Labs

Practical Bash scripting and Linux automation labs for DevOps learning.

## Current Scripts

- task1.sh → basic bash execution
- userinfo.sh → user input using read command
- disk_check.sh → check disk usage using df -h

## Topics Covered

- variables
- read command
- executable permissions
- bash execution
- disk monitoring basics

# Bash Scripting Notes — Variables + Exit Status

## Command Substitution
- `$(command)` runs command and stores output
- Used for saving dynamic values into variables

Example:
host=$(hostname)

## Common System Information Commands

### hostname
- Shows system hostname

### whoami
- Shows current logged-in user

### pwd
- Prints current working directory

## Printing Variables
Example:
echo "$host"

## Exit Status
- `$?` stores exit status of previous command
- Check immediately after command execution

Meaning:
- `0` = command success
- non-zero = command failure/error

## mkdir Exit Status Example
First run:
mkdir test
echo $?

- Returns `0` because directory created successfully

Second run:
mkdir test
echo $?

- Returns non-zero because directory already exists

## Important Learning
- Linux commands communicate success/failure using exit codes
- Scripts use exit codes for automation decisions and error handling
